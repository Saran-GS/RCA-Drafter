## What is RCA Agent?

Production incidents leave teams with evidence scattered across Slack threads, log dumps, and recent deploys. **RCA Agent** pulls that evidence together — incident timeline, error logs, and git diff — runs it through a multi-agent analysis pipeline, and produces a consistent, structured RCA report ready for review and documentation.

No cloud API keys. No rate limits. Runs entirely on your machine using a local model via Ollama.

              Structured RCA Report (Markdown)
```

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Timeline Agent** | Extracts ordered events and chronology from the incident timeline |
| **Log Agent** | Identifies recurring errors, anomalies, and affected services |
| **Diff Agent** | Reviews recent code changes and flags risky or likely-culprit modifications |
| **Synthesis Step** | Combines all agent findings into the final structured RCA report |

### Report Sections

Every generated report includes:

1. Incident Summary
2. Timeline
3. Root Cause
4. Contributing Factors
5. Impact Assessment
6. Resolution Steps Taken
7. Action Items
8. Prevention Measures
9. Lessons Learned

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.10+, Flask |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| AI Runtime | [Ollama](https://ollama.com) |
| Model | `phi3:mini` (local, no API key needed) |
| Report Format | Markdown |
| Storage | JSON files |

### Why local AI?

- **Privacy** — incident data never leaves your machine
- **No limits** — no rate limits or API quotas
- **Offline-friendly** — works in air-gapped or demo environments

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) installed and running
- Git
- A modern browser

### 1 — Pull the model

```bash
ollama pull phi3:mini
```

### 2 — Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3 — Run

```bash
python app.py
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. Open the app and sign in
2. Paste your incident **timeline**, **error logs**, and **git diff** into the form
3. Click **Run Analysis** — the agent pipeline processes your input
4. Review the generated RCA report
5. Export or save the report for your team

## AI Assistance Notes

AI tools were used throughout development for code generation, prompt design, and report drafting. Key observations:

- **Effective for:** structuring unstructured incident data, extracting patterns from logs, consistent report formatting
- **Watch out for:** over-inferring root causes when evidence is incomplete — always have a human review the final report before sharing

Prompts used during development are documented in [`Document/PROMPTS.md`](./Document/).

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Stronger authentication and session management
- [ ] Confidence scoring per agent finding
- [ ] PDF and DOCX export formats
- [ ] Richer dashboard with incident severity scoring
- [ ] Validation layer to cross-check agent conclusions
